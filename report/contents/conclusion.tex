\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


\paragraph{} In this study, we addressed the Dominator Partition Problem (DPP). To strengthen the model we constructed, we developed a series of valid inequalities.
We conducted performance tests on large, randomly generated connected graphs using an Erdős–Rényi framework. Results showed that the addition of valid inequalities noticably improved solver performance.

\paragraph{} Overall, this project demonstrates that valid inequalities not only improve the theoretical strength of an integer programming model but also yield substantial practical benefits in terms of solution time. Future work could investigate the case with variable $k$, i.e., with an objective minimizing the cardinality of $\pi$.
