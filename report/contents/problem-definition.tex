\section{Problem Description}

\paragraph{} Dominator Partition Problem is introduced by Hedetniemi and Haynes (2006) \cite{dominator_partitions}. In graph $G = (V, E)$, a vertex $v$ \textit{dominates} set $S \subseteq V$ if it's adjacent to all $u \in S$. 

\paragraph{} A \textbf{dominator partition} divides $V$ into $k$ blocks, such that each $v \in V$ dominates at least one of the blocks. The goal is to find the smallest such $k$, called $\pi_d(G)$. However, in our case, we will work with a fixed $k$ for simplicity.
